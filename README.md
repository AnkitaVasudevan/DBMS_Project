Online Movie Ticket  Management System created as part of DBMS Course 

------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT 1:

Deliverables of Assignment 1 are :
1. Identify Project title and create a problem statement mentioning all the relevant constraints.
2. ER Diagram with the incremental stages drawn to show the progress.
3. ER Diagram drawn online with the help of an online tool such as EDRAW,LucidChart.
4. Database complexity could be measured in terms of number of entity sets/tables -approximately 8 to 10. Accordingly 8 to 10 records per table should be entered, so that suitable queries are designed with this data.

------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT 2:

Deliverables of Assignment 2 are :
1. Mapping the conceptual model to Relational model.
